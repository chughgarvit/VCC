/**
  * A VM allocation policy that tries to place VMs which are closest to VMs previously submitted by the new VM's broker.
  *
  * It first checks whether the new VM can be placed within the same host as the last VM. If not, it tries to place the
  * new VM in the same rack (hosts connected to the same TOR switch) as the last VM. If it fails to do so, it searches
  * for a suitable host in the same row (hosts connected to the same aggregate switch) as the last VM. If still no
  * suitable host could be found, it searches the rest of the data center for a suitable host using "First Fit" policy.
  *
  * NOTE: This policy only works with [[NetworkHost]]s. For other kind of hosts, it falls back to "First Fit" policy.
  * Another caveat is that VM's submitted in bulk (without any delay) will always result in the "First Fit" policy to be
  * used, since the list of VM's submitted by the broker doesn't get populated until all VMs submitted at once have been
  * provisioned by the data center.
